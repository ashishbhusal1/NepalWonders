        <p>
          Nepal Wonders was founded on the belief that travel is more than just
          visiting new places â€“ it's about creating unforgettable experiences,
          forging connections, and enriching lives. Our journey began when a
          group of passionate travelers came together with a shared vision to
          redefine the way people explore the world.
